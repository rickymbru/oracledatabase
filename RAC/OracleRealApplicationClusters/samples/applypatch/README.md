Example of how to create a patched database image
=============================================
Once you have built your base Oracle RAC image image you can create a patched version of it.
In order to build such an image you will have to provide the patch zip file.
 
**Notes:** 
* Some patches require a newer version of `OPatch`, the Oracle Interim Patch Installer utility. It is highly recommended, you always update opatch with the new version. 
* You can only patch 19.3.0 and above using this script. To pach 18.3.0 and 12.2.0.1, you need to request oneoff from Oracle Support.
* The scripts will automatically install a newer OPatch version, if provided.

# The patch structure
The scripts used in this example rely on following directory structure:

    19.3.0
       patches
         grid
           001 (patch directory)
              pNNNNNN_RRRRRR.zip  (patch zip file)
           002 (optional)
           00N (optional, Nth patch directory)
         oracle 
           001 (patch directory)
              pNNNNNN_RRRRRR.zip  (patch zip file)
           002 (optional)
           00N (optional, Nth patch directory)
         opatch
           p6880880*.zip (optional, OPatch zip file)
       
**patches:** The working directory for patch installation.  
**grid:**: The directory containing patches(Release Update) for Oracle Grid Infrastructure.
**oracle:** The directory containing patches(Release Update) for Oracle RAC Home and Database.
**001:** The directory containing the patch(Release Update) zip file.  
**00N:** The second, third, ... directory containing the second, third, ... patch zip file.
This is useful if you want to install multiple patches at once. The script will
go into each of these directories in the numbered order and apply the patches.  
**Important**: It is up to the user to guarantee the patch order, if any.

# Installing the patch
You will need to build a new Docker image with the patches in place. In order
to do so, first copy the patch zip file into the 001 directory within the patches directory.
If you have multiple patches to be applied at once, add more sub directories following the
numbering scheme of 002, 003, 004, 005, 00N.  
If you have a new version of OPatch, put the OPatch zip file directly into the
patches directory. Do not change the name of the zip file!
A utility script named `buildPatchedDockerImage.sh` has been provided to assist with building
the patched image:

    [oracle@localhost applypatch]# ./buildPatchedDockerImage.sh -h
    
    Usage: ./buildPatchedDockerImage.sh -v [version] -p [patch label]
    Builds a patched Docker Image for Oracle Database.
    
    Parameters:
       -v: version to build
           Choose one of: 19.3.0
       -p: patch label to be used for the tag

**Important:** It is not supported to apply patches on already existing databases.
You will have to create a new, patched database Docker image. You can use the PDB unplug/plug
functionality to carry over your PDB into the patched container database!
